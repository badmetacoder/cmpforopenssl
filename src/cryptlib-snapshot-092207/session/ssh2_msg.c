/* Create a request for the appropriate type of service, either encrypted-
   telnet, SFTP (or more generically a subsystem), or port forwarding.
   There are several different port-forwarding mechanisms that we can use.
   A global request of type "tcpip-forward" requests forwarding of a remote
   port to the local system, specifying the remote port to be forwarded but
   without actually opening a session/channel, it's merely q request for
   future forwarding.  When a connection arrives on the remote port for
   which forwarding has been requested, the remote system opens a channel of
   type "forwarded-tcpip" to the local system.  To open a connection from a
   locally-forwarded port to a port on the remote system, the local system
   opens a channel of type "direct-tcpip" to the remote system:

	Pkt		Name			Arg1			Arg2		Comment
	---		----			----			----		-------
	open	"session"									Followed by pty-req
														or subsys
	open	"fded-tcpip"	remote_info (in)			Server -> client in
														response.to tcpip-fd
	open	"direct-tcpip"	remote_info		local_info	Client -> server, currently
														local_info = 127.0.0.1
	global	"tcpip-fd"		remote_info (out)			Request for remote
														forwarding

   Once we've opened a standard session, we need to follow it with either a
   pty-request + shell request or a subsystem request:

	Pkt		Name			Arg1			Arg2		Comment
	---		----			----			----		-------
	channel	"pty-req"
	channel "subsystem"		name

   In theory we could bundle the channel open + pty-request + shell request
   into a single packet group to save round-trips, but the packets sent after
   the channel open require the use of the receive-channel number supplied by
   the remote system.  This is usually the same as the send channel that we
   specify, but for some unknown reason Cisco use different send and receive
   channel numbers, requiring that we wait for the response to the channel-
   open before we send any subsequent packets, adding another RTT to the
   exchange */

			   when the other side tries to interpret a connection-layer

	   a channel close is, the general idea among implementors seems to be
	   that you should let output drain before you close your side, but
	   if you're in the middle of sending a 2GB file that's a lot of output
	   to drain).  This can also be complicated by implementation-specific
	   quirks, for example OpenSSH may hang more or less indefinitely if
	   there's output coming from a background process on the server.  This
	   is because of a rather obscure race condition that would occur if it
	   exited immediately in which the SSH server gets the SIGCHLD from the
	   (local) background process exiting before it's written all of its
	   data to the (local) pipe connecting it to the SSH server, so it
	   closes the (remote) SSH channel/connection before the last piece of
	   data comes over the (local) pipe.  Because the server won't close the
	   (remote) SSH connection until it's certain that the (local) process
	   has written all of its data, and it'll never get the EOF over the
	   pipe, it hangs forever.  This is a piece of Unix plumbing arcana that
	   doesn't really concern us, so again just exiting after a short wait
	   is the best response.

	   Since we're about to shut down the session anyway, we try
	   to read a basic channel close ack from the other side, if there's
	   anything more than that we drop it.  This is complicated somewhat by
	   the fact that what we're doing here is something that's normally
	   handled by the high-level read code in sess_rw.c.  What we implement
	   here is the absolute minimum needed to clear the stream
	   (sendCloseNotification() has set the necessary (small) nonzero
	   timeout for us) */

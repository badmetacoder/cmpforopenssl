/* Common code to read and write data over the secure connection.  This
   is called by the protocol-specific handlers, which supply three functions:

	readHeaderFunction()	- Reads the header for a packet and sets up
							  length information.
	processBodyFunction()	- Processes the body of a packet.
	preparePacketFunction()	- Wraps a packet in preparation for sending it.

   The behaviour of the network-level stream handlers is as follows:

	Timeout		byteCount		Result
	-------		---------		------
		  - error -				error
	  0			  0				0
	  0			> 0				byteCount
	> 0			  0				CRYPT_ERROR_TIMEOUT
	> 0			> 0				byteCount

   Errors in the processBodyFunction() and preparePacketFunction() are 
   always fatal.  In theory we could try to recover, however the functions 
   update assorted crypto state such as packet sequence numbers and IVs that 
   would be tricky to roll back, and in practice recoverable errors are 
   likely to be extremely rare (at best perhaps a CRYPT_ERROR_TIMEOUT for a 
   context tied to a device, however even this won't occur since the 
   conventional encryption and MAC contexts are all internal native 
   contexts), so there's little point in trying to make the functions 
   recoverable */

/* The read data code uses a helper function tryRead() that either reads
   everything which is available or to the end of the current packet.  In
   other words it's an atomic, all-or-nothing function that can be used by
   higher-level code to handle network-level packetisation.  Buffer
   management is handled as follows: The bPos index always points to the end
   of the decoded data (i.e. data that can be used by the user), if there's
   no partial packet present this index is the same as bEnd:

	----+------------------------
	////|
	----+------------------------
		^
		|
	bEnd/bPos

   If there's a partial packet present, pendingPacketRemaining contains the
   number of bytes required to complete the packet and bEnd points to the
   end of the received data, and is advanced as more data is read:

							<----> pPR
	----+-------------------+----+----
	////|///////////////////|....|
	----+-------------------+----+----
		^					^
		|					|
	  bPos				  bEnd

   Once the complete packet is read (pPR reaches 0), it's decrypted, and
   bPos and bEnd are adjusted to point to the end of the new data:

	----+------------------------+----
	////|////////////////////////|
	----+------------------------+----
								 ^
								 |
							 bEnd/bPos

   The handling of any header data present at the start of the packet
   depends on the packet format, if the header is independent of the
   encrypted data it's handled entirely by the readHeaderFunction() and 
   there's no need to provide special-case handling.  If the header is part 
   of the encrypted data, decryption is a two-stage operation in which
   readHeaderFunction() decrypts just enough of the packet to extract and
   process the header (depositing any leftover non-header data at the start
   of the buffer) and processBodyFunction() processes the rest of the data.

   Errors in the readHeaderFunction() are fatal if they come from the session
   protocol level (e.g. a MAC failure or bad packet) and nonfatal if they
   come from the network layer below the session (the stream-level code has
   its own handling of fatal vs. nonfatal errors, so we don't try and get
   down to that level) */

/* Send data to the remote system.  There are two strategies for handling 
   buffer filling and partial writes, either to fill the buffer as full as 
   possible and write it all at once, or to write complete packets as soon 
   as they're available.  We use the latter strategy here, both because it 
   considerably simplifies buffer management and because interleaving 
   (asynchronous) writes and packet processing increases the chances that 
   the current packet will be successfully dispatched across the network 
   while the next one is being encrypted - trying to asynchronously write a 
   large amount of data in one go practically guarantees that the write 
   won't complete.

   Session buffer management is handled as follows: The startOfs index 
   points to the start of the payload space in the buffer (everything before 
   this is header data).  The maxPacketSize value indicates the end of the 
   payload space relative to the startOfs:

	<- hdr->|<-- payload -->|
	+-------+---------------+---+
	|		|///////////////|	|
	+-------+---------------+---+
			^				^
			|				|
		startOfs	  maxPacketSize

   The bPos index moves from startsOfs to maxPacketSize, after which the 
   data is wrapped up by the protocol-specific code.  At this point bPos
   usually points past the end of maxPacketSize due to the addition of
   trailer data such as encryption block padding and a MAC.  Once the
   packet is assembled, the data is flushed and the bPos index reset:

		startOfs	  maxPacketSize
			|				|
			v				v
	+-------+-------+-------+---+
	|.......|.......|///////|///|
	+-------+-------+-------+---+
					^<--- to -->^
					|	write	|
			  partialBufPos	  bufPos

   As with reads, writes can be non-atomic, although on a more restrictive 
   scale than reads: Once an encrypted packet has been assembled in the 
   write buffer, the entire contents must be written before a new packet can 
   be assembled.  This guarantees that when the caller flushes data through 
   to the other side, all of the data will be sent (and the other side will 
   have a chance to react to it) before the next load of data can be flushed 
   through.

   Once we have partial data in the send buffer, all further attempts to
   add more data fail until the remainder of the partially-written data
   has been flushed.  This is handled by setting sendBufPartialBufPos to
   point to the first byte of unwritten data, so that 
   sendBufPartialBufPos ... sendBufPos remains to be written */

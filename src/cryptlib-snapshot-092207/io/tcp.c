/* cryptlib's separation kernel causes some problems with objects that use
   sockets, both because it doesn't allow sharing of sockets (which is a
   problem because the Unix server programming model assumes that a single
   process will listen on a socket and fork off children to handle incoming
   connections (in fact the accept() function more or less forces you to do
   this whether you want to or not)) and because when a thread is blocked in
   an object waiting on a socket there's no way to unblock it apart from
   killing the thread (actually we could create some sort of lookback socket
   and wait for it alongside the listen socket in the pre-accept select wait,
   signalling a shutdown by closing the loopback socket, but this starts to
   get ugly).  In order to work around this we maintain a socket pool that
   serves two functions:

	- Maintains a list of sockets that an object is listening on to allow a
	  listening socket to be reused rather than having to listen on a
	  socket and close it as soon as an incoming connection is made in
	  order to switch to the connected socket.

	- Allows sockets to be closed from another thread, which results in any
	  objects waiting on them being woken up and exiting.

   For now we limit the socket pool to a maximum of 256 sockets (16 in
   resource-constrained environments) both as a safety feature to protect
   against runaway apps and because cryptlib was never designed to function
   as a high-volume server application.  If necessary this can be changed to
   dynamically expand the socket pool in the same way that the kernel
   dynamically expands its object table.  However it's not a good idea to
   simply remove the restriction entirely (or set it to too high a value)
   because this can cause problems with excess consumption of kernel
   resources.  For example under Windows opening several tens of thousands
   of connections will eventually return WSAENOBUFS when the nonpaged pool
   is exhausted.  At this point things start to get problematic because
   many drivers don't handle the inability to allocate memory very well, and
   can start to fail and render the whole system unstable.  This is a
   general resource-consumption problem that affects all users of the shared
   nonpaged pool, but we can at least make sure that we're not the cause of
   any crashes by limiting our own consumption */

/* Wait for I/O to become possible on a socket.  The particular use of 
   select that we employ here is reasonably optimal under load because we're 
   only asking select() to monitor a single descriptor.  There are a variety 
   of inefficiencies related to select that fall into either the category of 
   user <-> kernel copying, or of descriptor list scanning.  For the first 
   category, when calling select() the system has to copy an entire list of 
   descriptors into kernel space and then back out again.  Large selects can 
   potentially contain hundreds or thousands of descriptors, which can in 
   turn involve allocating memory in the kernel and freeing it on return.  
   We're only using one so the amount of data to copy is minimal.

   The second category involves scanning the descriptor list, an O(n) 
   activity.  First the kernel has to scan the list to see whether there's 
   pending activity on a descriptor.  If there aren't any descriptors with 
   activity pending, it has to update the descriptor's selinfo entry in the 
   event that the calling process calls tsleep() (used to handle event-based 
   process blocking in the kernel) while waiting for activity on the 
   descriptor.  After the select() returns or the process is woken up from a 
   tsleep(), the user process in turn has to scan the list to see which 
   descriptors the kernel indicated as needing attention.  As a result, the 
   list has to be scanned three times.

   These problems arise because select() (and it's cousin poll()) are 
   stateless by design, so everything has to be recalculated on each call.  
   After various false starts the kqueue interface is now seen as the best 
   solution to this problem.  However, cryptlib's use of only a single 
   descriptor per select() avoids the need to use system-specific and rather 
   non-portable interfaces like kqueue (and earlier alternatives like Sun's 
   /dev/poll, FreeBSD's get_next_event(), and SGI's /dev/imon) */

	   that it isn't noticeable to the caller but ensures that we at least
	   get a chance to get anything that may be pending.

	   The exact wait time depends on the system, but usually it's quantised
	   to the system timer quantum.  This means that on Unix systems with a
	   1ms timer resolution, the wait time is quantised on a 1ms boundary.
	   Under Windows NT/2000/XP, it's quantised on a 10ms boundary (some
	   early NT systems had a granularity ranging from 7.5 - 15ms, but all
	   newer systems use 10ms) and for Win95/98/ME it's quantised on a 55ms
	   boundary.  In other words when performing a select() on a Win95 box
	   it'll either return immediately or wait some multiple of 55ms, even
	   with the time set to 1ms.

	   In theory we shouldn't have to reset either the fds or the timeval
	   each time through the loop since we're only waiting on one descriptor
	   so it's always set and the timeval is a const, however some versions
	   of Linux can update it if the select fails due to an EINTR (which is
	   the exact reason why we'd be going through the loop a second time)
	   and/or if a file descriptor changes status (e.g. due to data becoming
	   available) so we have to reset it each time to be on the safe side.
	   It would actually be nice if the tv value were updated to reflect how
	   long the select() had to wait since it'd provide a nice source of 
	   entropy for the randomness pool.

	   The wait on connect is a slightly special case, the socket will
	   become writeable if the connect succeeds normally, but both readable
	   and writeable if there's an error on the socket or if there's data
	   already waiting on the connection (i.e. it arrives as part of the

/* Close a connection.  Safely handling closes is extremely difficult due to
   a combination of the way TCP/IP (and TCP stacks) work and various bugs
   and quirks in implementations.  After a close (and particularly if short-
   timeout non-blocking writes are used), there can still be data left in
   TCP send buffers, and also as unacknowledged segments on the network.  At
   this point there's no easy way for the TCP stack to know how long it
   should hang around trying to get the data out and waiting for acks to come
   back.  If it doesn't wait long enough, it'll end up discarding unsent
   data.  If it waits too long, it could potentially wait forever in the
   presence of network outages or crashed peers.  What's worse, since the
   socket is now closed, there's no way to report any problems that may occur
   to the caller.

   We try and handle this with a combination of shutdown() and close(), but
   due to implementation bugs/quirks and the TCP stack issues above this
   doesn't work all of the time.  The details get very implementation-
   specific, for example with glibc the manpage says that setting SO_LINGER
   causes shutdown() not to return until queued messages are sent (which is
   wrong, and non non-glibc implementations like PHUX and Solaris
   specifically point out that only close() is affected), but that
   shutdown() discards unsent data.  glibc in turn is dependent on the
   kernel it's running on top of, under Linux shutdown() returns immediately
   but data is still sent regardless of the SO_LINGER setting.

   BSD Net/2 and later (which many stacks are derived from, including non-
   Unix systems like OS/2) returned immediately from a close() but still
   sent queued data on a best-effort basis.  With SO_LINGER set and a zero
   timeout the close was abortive (which Linux also implemented starting
   with the 2.4 kernel), and with a non-zero timeout it would wait until all
   the data was sent, which meant that it could block almost indefinitely
   (minutes or even hours, this is the worst-case behaviour mentioned
   above).  This was finally fixed in 4.4BSD (although a lot of 4.3BSD-
   derived stacks ended up with the indefinite-wait behaviour), but even
   then there was some confusion as to whether the wait time was in machine-
   specific ticks or seconds (Posix finally declared it to be seconds).
   Under Winsock, close() simply discards queued data while shutdown() has
   the same effect as under Linux, sending enqueued data asynchronously
   regardless of the SO_LINGER setting.

   This is a real mess to sort out safely, the best that we can do is to
   perform a shutdown() followed later by a close().  Messing with SO_LINGER
   is too risky, something like performing an ioWait() doesn't work either
   since it just results in whoever initiated the shutdown being blocked for
   the I/O wait time, and waiting for a recv() of 0 bytes isn't safe because
   the higher-level code may need to read back a shutdown ack from the other
   side, which a recv() performed here would interfere with.  Under Windows
   we could handle it by waiting for an FD_CLOSE to be posted, but this

/* Read and write data from and to a socket.  Because data can appear in
   bits and pieces when reading we have to implement timeout handling at two
   levels, once via ioWait() and a second time as an overall timeout.  If we
   only used ioWait() this could potentially stretch the overall timeout to
   (length * timeout) so we also perform a time check that leads to a worst-
   case timeout of (timeout-1 + timeout).  This is the same as the
   implementation of SO_SND/RCVTIMEO in Berkeley-derived implementations,
   where the timeout value is actually an interval timer rather than a
   absolute timer.

   In addition to the standard stream-based timeout, we can also be called
   with flags specifying explicit blocking behaviour (for a read where we
   know that we're expecting a certain amount of data) or explicit
   nonblocking behaviour (for speculative reads to fill a buffer).  These
   flags are used by the buffered-read routines, which try and speculatively
   read as much data as possible to avoid the many small reads required by
   some protocols.  We don't do the blocking read using MSG_WAITALL since
   this can (potentially) block forever if not all of the data arrives.

   Finally, if we're performing a blocking read (which is usually done when
   we're expecting a predetermined number of bytes), we dynamically adjust
   the timeout so that if data is streaming in at a steady rate, we don't
   abort the read just because there's more data to transfer than we can
   manage in the originally specified timeout interval.

   Handling of return values is as follows:

	timeout		byteCount		return
	-------		---------		------
		0			0				0
		0		  > 0			byteCount
	  > 0			0			CRYPT_ERROR_TIMEOUT
	  > 0		  > 0			byteCount

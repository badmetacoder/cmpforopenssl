/* Types of actions that can be performed on a piece of envelope data.  The 
   two key exchange actions are handled identically, but are given different 
   tags because we place PKC-based key exchange actions (which may be 
   handled automatically on de-enveloping) before conventional key exchange 
   actions (which usually require manual intervention for passphrases).  For 
   this reason the actions are given in their sort order (i.e. 
   ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE_PKC precedes ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE in the action list) */

typedef enum {
	ACTION_NONE,					/* Non-action */

	/* Pre-actions */

/* An 'action list' that defines what we need to do to the content when
   enveloping data.  There are three action lists, one for actions to perform
   before enveloping data, one to perform during enveloping (which is 
   actually just a single action rather than a list), and one to perform 
   after enveloping.  ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE and ACTION_KEYEXCHANGE_PKC are found 
   in the pre-enveloping list, ACTION_SIGN in the post-enveloping list, and 
   everything else in the during-enveloping list.

   Some actions are many-to-one, in which a number of controlling actions in
   one list may act on a single subject action in another list (for example a
   number of signature actions may sign the output from a single hash
   action).  This is handled by having the controlling actions maintain
   pointers to the subject action, for example a number of key export actions
   would point to one encryption action, with the export actions exporting
   the session key for the encryption action.

   The ACTION_NEEDSCONTROLLER flag records whether this is a subject action 
   that still requires a controlling action.  This allows us to identify 
   unused subject actions more easily than by scanning all controller->
   subject relationships.

   The ACTION_ADDEDAUTOMATICALLY flag records whether a subject action was 
   added automatically and invisibly to the caller as a result of adding a 
   controlling action, for example a hash action created when a signing 
   action is added.  This is to ensure that we don't return an error the 
   first time the caller adds an action which is identical to an 
   automatically added action */

   a somewhat complex FSM because the enveloping routines give the user the
   ability to push in arbitrary amounts of data corresponding to various
   enveloping structures and simultaneously pop out data/information based 
   on decoding them.  A typical complex enveloped type might contain a 
   number of headers, a session key encrypted with 18 different public keys, 
   five varieties of signature type, and God knows what else, of which the 
   caller might feed us 500 bytes - a small fraction of the total data - and 
   then ask for information on what they've just fed us.  We have to 
   remember how far we got (halfway through an RSA-encrypted DES key fifteen 
   levels of nesting down in an ASN.1 structure), process everything that we 
   can, and then get back to them on what we found.  Then they feed us 
   another few hundred bytes and the whole thing starts anew.

   The state machine works by processing one complete object or part of an
   object at a time and then moving on to the next state that corresponds to
   handling another part of the object or another object.  If there isn't
   enough data present to process a part or subpart, we return an underflow

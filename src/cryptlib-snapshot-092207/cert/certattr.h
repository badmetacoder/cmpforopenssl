/* The attribute type information.  This is used to both check the validity
   of encoded attribute data and to describe the structure of an attribute
   when encoding it.  The flags are broken down into the following groups:

	Attribute-specific flags that apply to an individual field or an
	overall attribute.

	SET/SEQUENCE control flags that indicate the end of a SET/SEQUENCE or
	nested SET/SEQUENCE.  These are only used for encoding, for decoding the 
	decoder maintains a parse state stack driver by the encoded data 
	(actually that's not quite correct, when skipping to the end of some 
	SEQUENCEs containing type-and-value pairs we also use the flags to locate 
	the end of the SEQUENCE encoding/start of the next type-and-value entry).  
	The rule for the FL_SEQEND values is that the last one must return the 
	nesting depth to 1, with the outer SEQUENCE being implicit.  In other 
	words a SEQUENCE OF SEQUENCE {} would have a FL_SEQEND value of 1; a 
	SEQUENCE OF GeneralName would have no FL_SEQEND value 

	Decoding level flags that indicate the compliance level at which this
	attribute is decoded.

	The object subtypes for which an attribute is valid.  CRLs actually 
	contain two sets of extensions, one for the entire CRL (crlExtensions) 
	and the other for each entry in the CRL (crlEntryExtension).  Sorting 
	out whether we're adding a CRL extension or per-entry extension is 
	handled by the higher-level code, which references the CRL attribute 
	list or per-entry attribute list as appropriate.

   The attribute flags are:

	FL_OPTIONAL: The field is optional.
	
	FL_DEFAULT: The field has a default value that's set if no field data
		is present.

	FL_EXPLICIT: The field is explicitly tagged, so instead of being en/
		decoded using the tag for the field, it's given a second level of 
		tagging that encapsulated the field's actual tag type.

	FL_IDENTIFIER: Used for the encapsulating SEQUENCE of fields of the type:

		SEQUENCE {
			identifier	OBJECT IDENTIFIER
			data		ANY DEFINED BY identifier
			}

		for which the field identified by a CRYPT_CERTINFO_xxx is the 'data'
		field, and the whole is only encoded if the data field is present.
		The overall item is only encoded if the 'data' field is present.

	FL_SETOF: Applied to the encapsulating SET/SEQUENCE of a SET OF x/
		SEQUENCE OF x to indicate that one or more inner fields may be 
		present.  The field marked with FL_SETOF in the encoding/decoding
		table is bookmarked, if all of the SET/SEQUENCE data isn't read the 
		first time through the decoding table position is restarted from the 
		bookmark until the SET/SEQUENCE data is exhausted.

	FL_NONEMPTY: Used for optional elements of a SET/SEQUENCE to indicate 
		that at least one element must be present.

	FL_NONENCODING: The field is read and written, but not associated with 
		any user data.  This is used for fields such as version numbers that 
		aren't used for encoding user-supplied data but that must be read and 
		written when processing an attribute 

	FL_MULTIVALUED: If a cryptlib-level attribute is part of a SET OF x/
		SEQUENCE OF x, this flag is set to indicate that more than one 
		instance can exist at the same time.  If this flag isn't set, 
		cryptlib will detect that an attribute of that type already exists 
		and refuse to allow a second instance to be added.

	FL_NOCOPY: The attribute is regarded as sensitive and therefore 
		shouldn't be copied from source to destination (e.g. from a cert 
		request into a cert) when the other attributes are copied.
    
	FL_CRITICAL: The overall extension is marked critical when encoding.

	FL_MORE: Another field in the current extension follows.  The last field
		in the extension has FL_MORE clear */

   a single field ID SUBJECT/ISSUERALTNAME that applies to the attribute as
   a whole, but also to the one and only field in it.

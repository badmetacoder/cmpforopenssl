/* This module and chk_cert.c implement the following PKIX checks (* =
   unhandled, see the code comments.  Currently only policy mapping is
   unhandled, this is optional in PKIX and given the nature of the
   kitchenSink extension no-one really knows how to apply it anyway).  For
   simplicity we use the more compact form of RFC 2459 rather than the 18
   page long one from RFC 3280.

	General:

	(a) Verify the basic certificate information:
		(1) The certificate signature is valid.
		(2a) The certificate has not expired.
		(2b) If present, the private key usage period is satisfied.
		(3) The certificate has not been revoked.
		(4a) The subject and issuer name chains correctly.
		(4b) If present, the subjectAltName and issuerAltName chains
			 correctly.

	NameConstraints:

	(b) Verify that the subject name or critical subjectAltName is consistent
		with the constrained subtrees.

	(c) Verify that the subject name or critical subjectAltName is consistent
		with the excluded subtrees.

	Policy Constraints:

	(d) Verify that policy info.is consistent with the initial policy set:
		(1) If the require explicit policy state variable is less than or 
			equal to n, a policy identifier in the certificate must be in 
			the initial policy set.
*		(2) If the policy mapping state variable is less than or equal to n, 
			the policy identifier may not be mapped.
		(3) RFC 3280 addition: If the inhibitAnyPolicy state variable is 
			less than or equal to n, the anyPolicy policy is no longer 
			considered a match (this also extends into (e) and (g) below).

	(e) Verify that policy info.is consistent with the acceptable policy set:
		(1) If the policies extension is marked critical, the policies
			extension must lie within the acceptable policy set.
		(2) The acceptable policy set is assigned the resulting intersection
			as its new value.

	(g) Verify that the intersection of the acceptable policy set and the
		initial policy set is non-null (this is covered by chaining of e(1)).

	Other Constraints:

	(f) Step (f) is missing in the original, it should probably be: Verify 
		that the current path length is less than the path length constraint.  
		If a path length constraint is present in the certificate, update it 
		as for policy constraints in (l).  RFC 3280 addition: If the cert is 
		a PKIX path kludge cert, it doesn't count for path length constraint
		purposes.

	(h) Recognize and process any other critical extension present in the
		certificate.

	(i) Verify that the certificate is a CA certificate.

	Update of state:

	(j) If permittedSubtrees is present in the certificate, set the
		constrained subtrees state variable to the intersection of its
		previous value and the value indicated in the extension field.

	(k) If excludedSubtrees is present in the certificate, set the excluded
		subtrees state variable to the union of its previous value and the
		value indicated in the extension field.

	(l) If a policy constraints extension is included in the certificate,
		modify the explicit policy and policy mapping state variables as
		follows:

		For any of { requireExplicitPolicy, inhibitPolicyMapping, 
		inhibitAnyPolicy }, if the constraint value is present and has value 
		r, the state variable is set to the minimum of (a) its current value 
		and (b) the sum of r and n (the current certificate in the 
		sequence) 

	(m) If a key usage extension is marked critical, ensure that the 
		keyCertSign bit is set */

	2. Trust the root of the chain that contains the identified cert (for

   trusted, although this means that all certs issued by that CA also have
   to be trusted, removing user control over certificate use.  This is

/* Check constraints along a cert chain in certInfoPtr from startCertIndex 
   on down, checked if complianceLevel >= CRYPT_COMPLIANCELEVEL_PKIX_FULL.  
   There are three types of constraints that can cover multiple certs: path 
   constraints, name constraints, and policy constraints.

   Path constraints are the easiest to check, just make sure that the number 
   of certs from the issuer to the leaf is less than the constraint length, 
   with special handling for PKIX path kludge certs.

   Name constraints are a bit more difficult, the abstract description
   requires building and maintaining a (potentially enormous) name constraint
   tree which is applied to each cert in turn as it's processed, however 
   since name constraints are practically nonexistant and chains are short
   it's more efficient to walk down the cert chain when a constraint is
   encountered and check each cert in turn, which avoids having to maintain
   massive amounts of state information and is no less efficient than a
   single monolithic state comparison.  Again, there's special handling for
   PKIX path kludge certs, see chk_cert.c for details.

   Policy constraints are hardest of all because, with the complex mishmash
   of policies, policy constraints, qualifiers, and mappings it turns out
   that no-one actually knows how to apply them, and even if people could
   agree, with the de facto use of the policy extension as the kitchenSink
   extension it's uncertain how to apply the constraints to typical
   kitchenSink constructs.  The ambiguity of name constraints when applied 
   to altNames is bad enough, with a 50/50 split in PKIX about whether it 
   should be an AND or OR operation, and whether a DN constraint applies to 
   a subjectName or altName or both.  In the absence of any consensus on the
   issue the latter was fixed in the final version of RFC 2459 by somewhat 
   arbitrarily requiring an AND rather than an OR, although how many 
   implementations follow exactly this version rather than the dozen earlier 
   drafts or any other profile or interpretation is unknown.  With policy 
   constraints it's even worse and no-one seems to be able to agree on what 
   to do with them (or more specifically, the people who write the standards 
   don't seem to be aware that there are ambiguities and inconsistencies in 
   the handling of these extensions.  Anyone who doesn't believe this is 
   invited to try implementing the path-processing algorithm in RFC 3280 as 
   described by the pseudocode there).
   
   For example, the various policy constraints in effect act as conditional 
   modifiers on the critical flag of the policies extension and/or the 
   various blah-policy-set settings in the path-processing algorithm, so 
   that under various conditions imposed by the constraints the extension 
   goes from being non-critical to being (effectively) critical.  In addition 
   the constraint extensions can have their own critical flags, which means 
   that we can end up having to chain back through multiple layers of 
   interacting constraint extensions spread across multiple certs to see 
   what the current interpretation of a particular extension is.  Finally, 
   the presence of PKIX path-kludge certs can turn enforcement of constraints
   on and off at various stages of path processing, with extra special cases
   containing exceptions to the exceptions.  In addition the path-kludge
   exceptions apply to some constraint types but not to others, although the
   main body of the spec and the pseudocode path-processing algorithm 
   disagree on which ones and when they're in effect (this implementation
   assumes that the body of the spec is authoritative and the pseudocode
   represents a buggy attempt to implement the spec, rather than the other
   way round).  Since the virtual-criticality can switch itself on and off 
   across certs depending on where in the path they are, the handling of 
   policy constraints is reduced to a complete chaos if we try and interpret 
   them as required by the spec - trying to implement the logic using 
   decision tables ends up with expressions of more than a dozen variables, 
   which indicates that the issue is more or less incomprehensible.  
   However, since it's only applied at the CRYPT_COMPLIANCELEVEL_PKIX_FULL 
   compliance level it's reasonably safe since users should be expecting 
   peculiar behaviour at this level anyway. 

   The requireExplicitPolicy constraint is particularly bizarre, it 
   specifies the number of additional certificates that can be present in 
   the path before the entire path needs to have policies present.  In other 
   words unlike all other length-based constraints (pathLenConstraint, 
   inhibitPolicyMapping, inhibitAnyPolicy) this works both forwards and
   *backwards* up and down the path, making it the PKI equivalent of a COME
   FROM in that at some random point down the path a constraint placed who
   knows where can suddenly retroactively render the previously-valid path 
   invalid.  No-one seems to know why it runs backwards or what the purpose
   of the retroactive triggering after n certs is, for now we only check
   forwards down the path in the manner of all the other length-based 
   constraints.
